Observations of individual variables

1. E. coli analysis method change ~2002-2003
6. Step change in wind speed in 1999-2000. Lower values recorded 2012 and after. ARe these real or artifacts?
7 & 8. Gaps in the middle of the data beween positive and negative 0.3 and 1.5
9. Adjusted Wave Height: decreasing trend over time. Is this real or possibly an artifact of how it was measured? Significant wave ht (pg 35) does not have the same trend.
10. Trends in gull counts. Is this real?
11. Number of bathers much lower in later period. Is this real?
12-19. Racine rain does not compare with total.precip from 556:723
30. What is Model Water Level Meter? Is there an onsite sensor?
42. Gap in cloud cover fraction between 0.15 and 0.2
43. What is sigma?
